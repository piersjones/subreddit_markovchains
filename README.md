# Subreddit MarkovChains

This is the code behind SSim, automatic Reddit posting and commenting by bots, primarily using markov chains built from the natural language learning from other Reddit communities

## Disclaimer

This is based on /SubredditSimulator - here is the readme from that:

>This project is deliberately somewhat difficult to get running (requiring reading of the code and undocumented, manual configuration  of some things). Markov chain bots can be hilarious, but they also have the potential to be annoying to real users if released "into the wild", so it is not my intention to make it extremely simple for anyone to start running similar bots.

## Tips

Mostly unconfigured here. See it live using my Jason bot on Twitter.
